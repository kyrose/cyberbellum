Adrift is the word that always comes to mind when describing myself.

I am adrift, in the sea or in space I do not know, but it does not matter either way. There isn't a home for me at the shores of either.

No foundation was laid generations ago, intended to last for generations to come.

Lacking cultural identity due to the nature of US. Being Mexican, but only nominally.
