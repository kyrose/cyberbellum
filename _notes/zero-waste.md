The [Zero Waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_waste){: .external-link} movement is guided by the desire to reduce the amount of materials sent to landfills, incinerators, and--most importantly--the ocean. It's a preventative plan-of-action, one that encourages responsibility on the part of both producers and consumers (contrast this with the recycling movement that puts all the onus on the consumer). 

"Whole systems approach"

## Why
I've always considered myself something of an environmentalist, though looking at my track record that word seems too strong. Environmentally sympathetic? I recycle, buy my clothes second-hand, pick up litter on hikes; these actions have become second nature, but they've also begun to feel hollow. I'm terrible at recycling, I don't sort, I've only recently started to meticulously clean each item and this is only partly due to laziness. Mostly, the recycling felt like a cynical project to me, and an effort to push the onus of waste reduction on the consumer, removing responsibility from corporations that could actually turn the tide. This feeling has (sadly) been [affirmed](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled){: .external-link}.

Unfortunately, I do not have the luxury of being cynically stuck in my ways. I'm disturbed by the amount of plastic accumulating in the ocean, in the stomachs of living beings across the globe. I believe every living creature has the right to life, to health, to freedom from preventable harm (ok, except [[on-feminism-and-roaches|roaches]]; hate those guys). For that belief to be more than empty verbiage means I must live and act in ways that respects all life and reduces what harm my living may cause. Producing less garbage, especially plastic garbage is one way I can put my money where my mouth is.
