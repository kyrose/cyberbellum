After a break, I've returned to [[Mark Fisher]]'s _Ghosts Of My Life_; a book I'm not even 100 pages in, but a book I can already feel the influence of.

I love this description of a depressive's experience (emphasis my own):

>"The depressive experiences himself as walled off from the lifeworld, so that his own frozen inner life -- or inner death -- overwhelms everything; at the same time, he experiences himself as evacuated, totally denuded, a shell: **there is nothing except the inside, but the inside is empty.**"

I love it because I've experienced it; I love it more because I am not living it at present.
