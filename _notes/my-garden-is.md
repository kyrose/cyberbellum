title: "My garden"
summary:
---

- a personal wiki, i.e. repository of knowledge gained (as opposed to information gathered)
- an archive of myself
- a place to learn about and express myself

but more importantly:
- A public thread of thoughts that provides resources for others


It is not (or should not be):
- highly structured
- unlinked
- closed (no way for others to respond)
- a blog
