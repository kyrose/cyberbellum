Without beginning, without end, without direction (isotropic). A completeness which subsumes all space and time. 

Democracy, [[anarchy]], an assembly of equals. The council circle, the round table.[^0]

## In the form of a halo
Dark halo. "Zone of light."

_What would it mean to invert the halo?_

## In the form of a rainbow
_"I set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth,"_ Genesis 9:13

_"The I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head,..."_ Revelation 10:1

Iris is the Greek goddess of the rainbow, and a messenger of the gods (a feminine Hermes). Again, we see the rainbow represent communication between the heavens and the earth.

>The union of earthly and divine

## In the form of the ouroboros
The circle symbolizes infinity. It is endless, a polygon with an infinite number of sides. The ouroboros consumes and rebirths itself _ad infinitum_. It is in a cycle of destruction and recreation, it never disappears, only changes.

Alchemical symbol for change. Continuous renewal, resurrection (the snake, continually reborn as it sheds its skin).[^1]

Harmony of opposites.[^1]
