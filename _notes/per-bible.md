"...how has it become acceptable that so many people, and especially so many young people, are [mentally] ill? The 'mental health plague' in capitalist societies would suggest that, instead of being the only social system that works, capitalism is inherently dysfunctional, and that the cost of it appearing to work is very high."[^1]

"The opposite of a true statement is a false statement, but the opposite of a profound truth can be another profound truth."[^2]
