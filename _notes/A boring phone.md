Inspired by [this blog post by nomasters.io](https://nomasters.io/posts/dumber-phone/). And [[Mark Fisher]]'s talk at the 2011 Virtual Futures conference.

I want to use my phone (all tech) more [[mindfully|mindfulness]]. Doing several enjoyable things at once (scrolling through are.na while watching TV while hanging out with my fiance) doesn't actually bring more enjoyment to my life--in fact, it actually takes away from that enjoyment.

I like the idea of removing distractions and certain "utility" from my phone in order to make it less appealing. I want to take back control of my life, my enjoyment.
