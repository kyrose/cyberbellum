summary:
---

- A personal handbook for keeping track of what helps me get through a bad day/moment, what leads (or has led) to success, and whatever else works for me. A user manual for my brain.

  Adam Dachis first proposed this idea in a lifehacker article (["Create a Personal Handbook for Quick Answers to All Your Problems"](https://lifehacker.com/create-a-personal-handbook-for-quick-answers-to-all-you-5774034))
