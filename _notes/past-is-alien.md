title: '"The Past is an Alien Planet"'
summary: separation in time
---

The word "alien" invokes images of the midnight expanses of space, unfathomable distances, faraway planets. To be alien, it would seem, means to be separated by distance. But distance isn't the only thing that creates differences that would make us alien to another: time does the very same.

The idea that time makes an alien as much as distance does keeps appearing in what I'm reading. [Mark Fisher](/mark-fisher){: .internal-link} brings up the idea in blog posts about the show _Life On Mars_, whose title itself harkens to the concept (the show is about a man from present day waking in the 70s). Ursula K. Le Guin considered the concept an important part of her novels.
