I'm tired of breaking out, but I'm also tired of my million-step skincare routine.

Probiotic skincare is "it" right now: the introduction of beneficial bacteria is [supposed to help with acne](https://www.byrdie.com/probiotic-skincare). Serums are suggested, but probiotic cleansers don't affect the skin's pH, so following with a toner is unnecessary.
