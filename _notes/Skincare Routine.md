I'm tired of breaking out, but I'm also tired of my million-step skincare routine.

Try to find local brands who produce in small batches. [PuppySkin](https://puppyskin.com) is a great option.

Currently I use a vitamin C in the morning for "brightening". Vitamin C is said to a) protect against environmental stressors, b) promote collagen production (get rid of fine lines), and c) reduce hyperpigmentation. The first two are necessary, not so much the third.

Probiotic skincare is "it" right now: the introduction of beneficial bacteria is [supposed to help with acne](https://www.byrdie.com/probiotic-skincare). Serums are suggested, but probiotic cleansers don't affect the skin's pH, so following with a toner is unnecessary.

Jojoba oil is an emollient and potentially protects against environmental damage. It is known to reduce inflammation. It also regulates oil production and (possibly) is antibacterial; these last three points make it great for acne. I remember reading it possibly reduces the appearance of fine lines. Possibly a product to replace the vitamin C and retinol.

## Possible morning routine
- Cleanser: [Probiotic Cleansing Emulsion](https://puppyskin.com/collections/cleansers/products/probiotic-cleansing-emulsion) from PuppySkin
- Treatment: [Jojoba oil](https://www.thejojobacompany.com/collections/all-products/products/100-natural-australian-jojoba) mixed with [Shea butter]()
- SPF

## Possible night routine
- Same cleanser as above
- Treatment: [Milk Peel Sleeping Mask](https://puppyskin.com/collections/acid-peel/products/milk-peel) (1-2 nights a week)
- Jojoba oil mixed with Shea butter
