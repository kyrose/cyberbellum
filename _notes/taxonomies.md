## Life as Language
A mental model to encourage us to view all human disciplines (design, physics, rock climbing, plumbing, photography, meditation, gardening, music) as discrete languages, in order to:

1.  Place communication at the heart of our actions.
2.  Adopt the same malleability that verbal language has into our own disciplines
3.  Encourage combinatorial creativity by considering how disciplines may be "translated"
4.  Providing a new framework to think about the structure of a discipline within the context of language - syntax, grammar, etc.
